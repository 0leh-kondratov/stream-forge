## Part IV: Future Prospects: StreamForge Roadmap

The current architecture of the StreamForge platform provides a solid foundation for further development. Within the strategic planning, the following key directions for system evolution have been identified:

### Chapter 11: Self-Healing Engine: Automated Functionality Recovery

**Objective:** Development of an intelligent operator capable of autonomously monitoring the state of system's working components and initiating their recovery in case of performance degradation or partial failure, even in the absence of a complete pod crash.

**Operating Principle:**
1.  The operator will continuously monitor events published to the `queue-events` topic.
2.  In case of a prolonged absence of events from a specific Job or the registration of a critical error, the operator will identify the Job as "stuck" or "faulty."
3.  The problematic Job will be automatically deleted, and a new instance will be launched to resume task execution, ensuring self-healing of the system at the business logic level.

### Chapter 12: Chaos Engineering: System Resilience Verification

**Objective:** Systematic and automated assessment of the system's resilience to various types of failures and abnormal situations.

**Examples of Planned Experiments:**
*   **`pod-delete`:** Initiating random deletion of `loader-*` or `arango-connector` pods to verify the correct operation of the Self-Healing operator in restarting them.
*   **`network-latency`:** Artificially introducing network delays between microservices and Apache Kafka to evaluate system behavior under degraded network connectivity.
*   **`kafka-broker-failure`:** Simulating the failure of one of the Kafka brokers to confirm the fault tolerance provided by the Strimzi operator.

### Chapter 13: Progressive Delivery: Safe Deployment Strategies

**Objective:** Minimizing risks associated with updating critical system components, such as `queue-manager`, through the application of progressive delivery strategies.

**Implementation Mechanism (Canary Release with `Argo Rollouts`):**
1.  `Argo Rollouts` deploys a new version of `queue-manager` in parallel with the existing stable version, directing a small percentage of incoming traffic to it (e.g., 10%).
2.  Continuous monitoring of key metrics of the new version is performed to assess its performance and stability.
3.  Upon successful validation, `Argo Rollouts` gradually increases the traffic share to 100%. If metric degradation or errors are detected, the system automatically rolls back to the previous stable version.
