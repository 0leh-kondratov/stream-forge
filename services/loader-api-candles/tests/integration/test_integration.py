# This file is for integration tests.
# True integration tests would typically involve:
# 1. Running actual (or highly realistic mock) external services like Kafka and a Binance API server.
# 2. Deploying the loader-api-candles service (e.g., as a Docker container or a local process).
# 3. Sending control commands to the service via Kafka (e.g., start, stop).
# 4. Verifying that the service fetches data from the mock API.
# 5. Verifying that the service publishes data to the mock Kafka topic.
# 6. Verifying telemetry events are sent correctly.
# 7. Checking Prometheus metrics exposed by the service.

# Due to the limitations of this environment (cannot spin up external services),
# these tests will remain as conceptual examples or require external setup.

# Example of what an integration test might look like (conceptual):
# @pytest.mark.asyncio
# async def test_full_loader_flow_integration():
#     # Setup:
#     # - Start mock Kafka broker (e.g., using testcontainers-python)
#     # - Start mock Binance API server (e.g., using aiohttp_server or httpx.MockTransport)
#     # - Set environment variables for the loader service to point to mocks
#     # - Run the loader-api-candles service in a separate process/thread

#     # Action:
#     # - Send a "start" command to the loader via mock Kafka control topic
#     # - Wait for data to be produced to the mock Kafka data topic
#     # - Send a "stop" command to the loader

#     # Assertions:
#     # - Verify data received in mock Kafka data topic matches expected API responses
#     # - Verify telemetry events (started, loading, finished) are received
#     # - Verify service shuts down gracefully

#     # Teardown:
#     # - Stop all mock services and the loader service

def test_loader_api_candles_integration_placeholder():
    # This is a placeholder. Real integration tests would go here.
    # For now, we rely on comprehensive unit tests and manual end-to-end testing.
